6. rm - a Linux command that stands for remove here. rm command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on from the file system like UNIX. To use, type "rm (file)".

8. Home directory and ~ - a home directory, also called a login directory, is the directory on Unix-like operating systems that serves as the repository for a user's personal files, directories and programs. The ~ symbol stands for a "tilde" to denote a user's home directory. Thus tilde slash (~/) is the beginning of a path to a file or directory below the user's home directory. ... Note: Quite often, the succeeding file or directory name is preceded by a period (".") which indicates that it is hidden (in Linux).
<br><br>
9. file paths in linux - A file path is the human-readable representation of a file or folder’s location on a computer system. Ex: /home/seth/Pictures/penguin.jpg . Can be found by typing "pwd" where you want to know the file path.
<br><br>
10. Using the tab key to complete file paths - this is a way to complete a file path without typing it out entirely. To use, start typing the file path, then press tab, and if you typed it correctly so far, it finishes it for you.
<br><br>
11. Using up and down arrow for history - this is a way to access previous commands typed in a terminal using the up and down arrow keys. To use, press the up arrow key after previously entering in commands to navigate previous commands.  To go back, press the down arrow key to return to newer commands you typed.
